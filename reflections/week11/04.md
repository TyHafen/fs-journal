## Questions

I have loved almost everything in the course. My favorite so far has been c# and dot.net stuff. the thing Im worried about the most is the front end only because its beena few weeks since I last used Vue. I lan on taking a break every hour pretty much. That is the hardest thing for me, to timebox properly.
