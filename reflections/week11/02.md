## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is a unique piece of information that is different for every row on a table. They cannot be null, they must exist. Its like having a table where the maker of the video game may be repeated in thee creator name slot, but for each specific instance, their will be an Id on the table for that and only that.

A foreign key however allows you to track down a specific instance on a table. The example in the reading mentioned having many of the same type of car in the same color, but being given the license plate number of the specific instance you want.

2. What is an `Alias`?

When you are joining two table but they each have their own column or characterist that has the same column name. For an example the list of instructors for codeworks would have a column for name, and the table of students would have a column labelled name. So when you merge the tables and have a list of the students and append the teachers name, you can alias the column name AS instructor name.



3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
SELECT * FROM doctors WHERE doctor.id = doctorId and patient.Id = patientId

```

I have come to the conclusion that I love c# and strictly typed languages. The CRUD methods are so much easier to follow with this language and SQL is an amazing way to manage datatables. I am enjoying this language greatly.
