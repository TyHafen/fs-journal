## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
Inheritance allows a class (the child) to  inherit methods from the parent class. This means its can have all of its own methods contained, but also those of its parents class. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

In member inheritance private methods cannot be accessed from the parent classes. This works by setting the method to private rather than a public one.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

A method of a parent class can be unaccessible by a child depending on how you set up the method. If it isnt accessible then the child cant use that method in its own scope. where as a public method a child class can use it just as easily as it was its own method.
