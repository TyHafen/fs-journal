## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

1) Pending - this is the state before the promise works or doesnt

2) Resolved - When the promise is completed

3) Rejected - When the promise is not kept

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

 they resolve callback hell by using chaining. This is attaching callbacks rather than passing them, creating easier to read code using then() and catch().

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

then() is used to move on after a resolved promise.

catch() is used when a promise gets rejected.

I need to slow down on my coding. I half way start everything from a template to getting my data from an api. It will throw tons of errors and its hard to debug one when I have 5 different errors. I find it really hard to find a starting point. I feel like Im really behind on my coding flow.
