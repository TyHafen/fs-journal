## Questions

1) Pending - this is the state before the promise works or doesnt

2) Resolved - When the promise is completed

3) Rejected - When the promise isnt kept

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

 they resolve callback hell by using chaining. This is attaching callbacks rather than passing them, creating easier to read code using then() and catch().

then() is used to move on after a resolved promise.

catch() is used when a promise gets rejected.
