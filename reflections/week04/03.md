## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?


It came around to push promises and generators. Promises were meant tofix the callback hell but  they still made code messy. Its synchronous in how it is written but acts async behind the scenes. It also made it way easier to debug.


2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

the client function  needs to be define async! that way the calling function will stop until that promise comes back. you cant eat the rice crispy if it isnt there before someone brings you one.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

I love that you  can write it just like regular code without the callback hell. I honestly cant even read code that in callback hell. Its clean, and syncs can be linked together. also the debugging is easier too. The fact that we use try catches within them make it sooooooo nice to debug. Not saying Im good at it, I cant just do a better job of it.

One take away from today was to go slowly through your logic. I took notes specifically to make a flow for myself when getting started on the days project. It turned out I wasnt any slower than when I try to hook stuff up but dont have a reason to 'this', or do 'that' first. It helped solidify it in my mind rather than scrambling around the files not knowing what I am even looking for or trying to d next.
