## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for REpresentation State Transfer. WHen called the server will transfer a representation of the state of requested data. Usually an API will send back info in JSON format. When you request information from the server it depends on a URL and the operations you want the server to do for you, ie get post, put or delete.

2. What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means the server doesnt remember anything about the user. That goes to operations, like if you were to post, put or delete, it wouldnt remember or care that you did so. Each request contains all the information the server needs to work in a request and return response.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?


/api/coll (for collect) id/ subcollection/ subID
 I think that is what the question is asking. You are  also supposed to make everything hyphenated because it makes it easier to read, like kabob style .

ITs import to know what you are trying to do the data you are using from APIS. like are you mapping an array, are you putting something into an array, are you getting something specific like on object or do you want to bring back an array of objects. it will make it helpful when planning out an application. You could even make a flow chart on a whiteboard telling you what you need each thing to do. Harrison did that on a whiteboard today and it made the whole process super vivid.
