> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

 some examples of call back hell are 'pyramid shapes' and a ton of if statements. it happens when you write JS execution from top to bottom.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
async means it will happen later and not immediately. Mick had a good example of a rice crispy treat and asking someone to get him one. its like asking for a rice crispy treat and before the person gets back with one, you are already trying to eat it. Visually the example makes sense. you cannot execute the eat function until the data is retrieved, aka the treat.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

1) keep code shallow
    name functions, this will allow you to have references when you get errors. move function to top level of program and use function hoisting

2) modularize
    I think what this is talking about is keep the logic of the function separate from invoking it? like how we have controller and service. the function can now be used in other areas of the code without duplicating it.
    
3) Handle every error
    this is about making stable code. This one I really need to do. i feel like whenever i try to do something and it doesnt work, my whole program fails. have the first line of code handle errors, so that you are encouraged to fix your errors.
