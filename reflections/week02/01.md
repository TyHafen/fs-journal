## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
where variables are able to be used, globally or function or locally

2. What is Hoisting ?
hoisting is when a variable or function is moved to the top of their scope before execution

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
const is when a variable is never going to change through the entire code.
let is used in blocks and cannot be redeclared within its scope.

var is global or functional, meaning it can be used universally within the code if initially creted outside a functiin. if created within a function it can only be used in that soecific function, otherwise it wont work

make sure to test code often after ever step. I kept messing up on that today and its hard to debug several lines of code at a time.
