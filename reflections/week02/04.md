## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
    taking on smaller challenges when you go. Think of what could be the best path and keep a small construct of your idea. dont make the plan soo extensive because the plan will change.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
    when you find a solution dont think that its the end all of your problems. if you doubt your solution you should rethink it!

    leave code cleaner than when you started with it. Dont throw code into messy code. clean something up so that it can be easier to understand

My code was messy and frustrating to work in today. While I was getting a better understanding of how things worked, I was leaving behind useless code that could accomplish the same task in fewer lines, and that was easier to read. I wish I would have hit everything in my goals fo today but if i approach the problems  slower and create clean content from the start it should be easier to place everything that I need to in the code.
