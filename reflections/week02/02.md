## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

function name(parameters){

}

let name = function(parameters) {

}

let name = (parameters) => {

}

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

parameters are used in the definition of the function, arguments are the values typed in when invoking the function

function doSomething(parameters){

}

then when invoked:
doSomething(arguments)


3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

a higher order function is a function that takes a function as a parameter or a function thats job is to give you a function. another example may be accepting an entire array as a parameter and the function iterating through the array and pushing out some result where each number in the array has been multiplied by 5.

Today was my hardest day so far. However whenever I got stuck and was wondering if my function was gonna work or why it wasnt working Jeremy reminded me of using my console.log() to see if I was getting ym intended results. I find it really hard to debug in this stage cause it feels super conceptual to me. I have to remember to work in small steps!
