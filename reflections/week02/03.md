## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log() whatever you put into this will show up in your console. it works best with testing code. so if you make a function and add a line of code into it that says console.log('this function works') and it appears in the dev tools it is your way of knowing the JS is reaching the DOM

errors are also printed to the console. so when an error happens the console will tell you what line and in what language (JS, CSS, HTML) the error happened and what type of error. extremely valuable tools to use.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
the elemets tab allows you to see the HTML and CSS of your code. it can b helpful because it can show you preset bootstrap function and what they do, as what your own css does.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
JavaScript debugging in the sources in your dev tools it will be in the right window.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
One take away is to make sure to work slowly through your framework and understand how to set up your HTML to support your JS. I had trouble today thinking of how to show in an organized fashion two different arrays. so instead I had to combine them which I was bummed about. I became scatter brained before I even started working on todays material all because I didnt keep code organized. I need to slow down when thinking about nested rows and templates.
