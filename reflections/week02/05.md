# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What would you count as a victory?
    This week seemed really tough to start off and when thursdays daily project came it really helped me solidify my knowledge when working with a partner. Thursdays fireside also helped me realize how complicated I was making my code when it could be more efficient. Friday when we got the prompt for the checkpoint I was having a lot of anxiety and freaking out a little internally. When I started working on the project and applying what I learned from the fireside I  realized what that I knew more than I thought and was able to get almost all of my functions working before I left the lab. IT felt great proving the voice inside my head wrong.
