## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

With efficient communication you can reduce the number of meetings. using a messaging system like slack can also stream line the communication and help work move forward. 


2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

The teams communication needs to be efficient. If you have a team of five people and you are constantly taking members away from work for meetings, then the work itself is going to slow down. In a smaller team you need to make sure they are ultimately allowed to work as well. You can easily over communicate and get no work done relative to how much communication there has been.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

good service cheap wont be fast - You cannot expect something to come to you faster if you arent paying for it. not necessarily money wise either. 

good service fast wont be cheap - there is a toll for good fast service and it is probably money. If you need to progress fastly on a project and need to bring more team members on, or need current members to work extra its not only gonna cost money, but also those workers might end up fatigued. 

fast service cheap wont be good - nothing ever really good comes out of rushing something for the least amount of dollars. While you can get a result, it probably wont be the quality of results you want.

Getting this project going has been exciting but scary. The backend is confusing the heck out of me because its hard to distinguish what data we need to hold onto or what the parent child relationships are like.
