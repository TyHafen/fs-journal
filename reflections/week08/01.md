## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It provides visibility, helps you show you can program, and also it can make you stand out as an individual. Its basically a way to promote your capabilities as a developer.



2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

You should have projects based on things you care about. You can build the simple apps if you want but maybe building something for a friend or relative is a good way to help you give the project more effective. Also fo  your projects while it is okay to have those standard apps on your resume, its best if they have suer clean and efficient code.


3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

This capstone project we are working on now will be a good one to have. Just because I feel like all Ive been able to accomplish on our checkpoints has been functionality, I dont feel like any of mine so far are good enough to show. Maybe the moon miner one because its simple and has clean code thats easy to follow.

Today was really stressful and I felt like I couldnt get enough done to save my life. Luckily I made some progress and that was enough for me to feel good about just continuing to work when it gets really hard.
