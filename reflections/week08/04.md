## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing- allows us to test individual sections of code. 

Component testing - making sure each vue component  reliably works how it need to while being mounted to the dom. 

End to end testing - This type of testing is beneficial because it is more of an overview style of testing and sees how all the components can work together. In the two earlier examples the scope of the test is only to that small section of code while end to end covers a larger portion of the app.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think the component method seems to be the most useful because in vue  so far, it seems like the entire app is based of of how your components interact with each other. And if one component  isnt working properly, then it can have a sort of cascading effect.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

It isnt that I think it isnt useful, but mostly that I cant relate to it as well as i can component testing, but I think unit testing might be the least useful. I feel like the units of code I write are pretty small (but also I havent worked on a large project before,) and that it is such small code it might be testing for the sake of testing. If that makes sense.

Our group is slowly move out of the backend and some of us are headed into the front end. It seemed important however that when someone is getting fatigued on whatever they are working on, that someone else is willing to move into their spot so thay can have a break.
