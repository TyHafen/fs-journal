## Questions

1. What are props?

Props are read only variables and they are how you pass information around all your components. Its like a far more efficient way than injecting in the MVC model

2. What are props used for?

Props are used to pass information to different components. They allow use to bypass the 'this.' style of our model templates and access that information directly. Because our dom will have multiple components its important to have a way to display appstate information in all of these components if we need.

3. Where can props be used or accessed?

they can be used in the export default section of our component and then you can use binding to pass data from a parent to a child in your work. They dont access data directly from the appstate. The data first must be passed through a parent

Adding data to the page is so much easier in Vue. I love not having to create a model but instead being able to compute data over and then being able to use css to style that data all within the same page.vue file. This has sped up the process of getting info to the page by a long shot
