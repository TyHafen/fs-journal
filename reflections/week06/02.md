## Questions

1. What are props?
Props are read only variables and they are how you pass information around all your components. Its like a far more efficient way than injecting in the MVC model

2. What are props used for?
Props are used to pass information to different components. They allow use to bypass the 'this.' style of our model templates and access that information directly. Because our dom will have multiple components its important to have a way to display appstate information in all of these components if we need.

3. Where can props be used or accessed?
they can be used in the export default section of our component and then you can use {{}} or binding depending on what you need to inject them into your models.
