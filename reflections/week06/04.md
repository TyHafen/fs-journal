## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

a nested route is a route that can move you from a parent page to a specific child component, usually when clicking on something on the page. A loose way to describe it would be like moving to a more descriptive page for something displayed on the parent page

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

You can use nested routes to go to a specific profile, like in todays blog application. by creating a route based off of an ID attached to a blog post. You could even do one from a main page in vue to a separate route tha shows more details than whats displayed on the page. Again from todays work, the main blog page can take you to a full page displaying a specific blog using a nested route.   

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes you can pass parameters through nested routes. It really wouldnt make sense if you couldnt. Otherwise you would have a chid without the access of information that their parent had. You would do this if you need data to go to child from that parents.
