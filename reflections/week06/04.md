## Questions

1. What is a nested route?
a nested route is a route that can move you from a parent page to a specific child component, usually when clicking on something on the page. A loose way to describe it would be like moving to a more descriptive page for something displayed on the parent page

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

You can use nested routes to go to a specific profile, like in todays blog application. by creating a route based off of an ID attached to a blog post. You could even do one from a main page in vue to a seperate route tha shows more details than whats displayed on the page. Again from todays work, the main blog page can take you to a full page displaying a specific blog using a nested route.   

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
