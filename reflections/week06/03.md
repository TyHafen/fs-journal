## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

they are a window into how your library works. It allows you to see the the creation, use and death of your components during the coding process.

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

Today we used the mounting hook  to take that initial data and display it to the DOM after we went and got data from the API. We also used the creation hook to retrieve data as well from the API.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

 the mounting hook lets you use your components right before and after the first render. Do not use them if you need to bring in some data to your component though. that is what a creation hook is for.

I noticed that the first tasks of setting up and connecting your files in Vue is so much easier than in MVC. It used to take me a while (not only cause Im a novice) to get my mai.js, my controllers, and my services going. then creating models and passing templates to the  dom took forever. With vue i can get it done so much faster and efficiently. Its also easier to track my work along the way
