## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

    It helps with multiple developments of the project. This allows different code to be tested within the project. If the secondary branch or "test" branch is something that ends up needingto be put into the master branch then you can merge the two.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

    Git tracks changes in projects and their codes, while github is a repository for such projects that can be shared with other deveolpers.
