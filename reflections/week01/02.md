## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

a Pseudo-Class helps with defining the current state of an elelment. A few exmples I think Id use alot would be the hover, for when the user is hovering over something on the page, and the visited which could be changing the color of a hyperlink once you have followed that specific link

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is how to determine what rule will have higher priority if you have two different rules affecting your element. It can benefit you beacuse it is creating a hiarchy of rules based on value given to a selector.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you were to overuse the !important feature all of your specificity would become null. Basically why use a system to create order in your CSS if you are gonna create exceptions all the time.

One take away from today is that you need to make your CSS easy and concise. If your flow through your CSS isnt well put together its gonna make it hard to go back and change it. Example would be making sure specificity is clean and easy to follow.
