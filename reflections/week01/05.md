# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    This week I felt like I was able to stay focused and positive on the tasks everyday
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    It kind of shocked me how excited and energzing the first week was. ITs been since college since I have stretched my brain this much and Im finding it very refreshing
- What are you struggling with?
    I am still in doubts at moments  about how I will do long term but as long as I keep focused and time manage well I feel loike Ill be able to survive.
- What would you count as a victory?
    Id count just showing up being ready to go as a victory. Im not one to step out of my comfort zone in such a big way like quitting my job and forcing myself into a career switch, but doing so has brought so much happiness thus far.
