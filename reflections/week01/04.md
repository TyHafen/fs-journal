## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
they are used to create ideas between developers, and user feedback. rhey are used to communicate an idea with an extremely low cost and  time usage.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
low-fidelity - easy to mock up, can be done on a piece of paper.

mid-fidelity - could add shading to show important of certain titles, paragraphs or sentences. usually on a digital wireframe, makingit easier to share wiith others.

 high-fidelity- isntead of filler language in paragraphs or Xs for photos, a high fidelity wireframe might include relevant content in the form of photos or text.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    i tihnk wireframes are important yes. Even on a small scale exampl like in class, where we are only doing a mock of a single page, its nice to see a layout be correct and accurate before jumping into the smaller details. on larger projects the wireframe phase will take alot longer but give everyone involved a clear idea of where the end result should land.

take your time and map your layout as best as you can before diving in, for example make sure all of your containers, row, and columns are positioned correctly and neat before rushing into filling them out. It will also make your code alot eaier to navigate the cleaner the html layout is.
