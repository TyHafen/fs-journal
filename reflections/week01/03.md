## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
    using weight and emphasis to make import titles or sentences pop rather than font size. I automatically use H tags to create that effect and i can see how it can get a little too predictable without adding much to the UI.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
https://www.backcountry.com/ 

backcountry to me mimics clean website design and in person shopping. They have specific popular brands to select from the homepage, a sales section, and groupings of gear for various outdoor activities all vieable on the homepage.

https://www.doordash.com/
a food delivery service doesnt need to be hard to use or have a ton of information. they show popular food options with a clean design. seems like a fool proof website. if it wasnt easy to use then potential users would move onto another delivery service.

https://www.apple.com/
a classic example of a website. the images are crisp, bright and pop off the screen. It shows off their latest projects while still having the ability to use a nav bar for all of their other services.


3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I think good design can tell the viewer that a company or product is neat, reliable and efficient based off of design along. if a simple site is hard to navigate or doesnt have a natural flow it could deter users away from whatever they need to get out of the website. i myself have thought "man if this is what their website is like, I cant imagine how this business is ran." simply based off of design alone.

Previous developers understood the struggle with certain aspects of CSS and HTML. they did some "dirty" work to create these frameeworks to make future jobs easier. without tools like this all of our jobs would be a little harder.
