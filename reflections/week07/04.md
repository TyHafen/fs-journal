# Sprint Retrospective

![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I implemented being as vocal as I could be and trying to portray my thoughts as clearly as possible. It is hard talking to someone in code when the person I talk to in code is myself..... in my head. I also let myself take breaks even when they werent scheduled just to allow some mental flexibility. If i had just finished something that took alot of brain power Id let my partner take over nd work for a minute.

2. What went well this week?

i was very tolerant and open to suggestions from my partner. I didnt mind trying their way even if I thought mine was better. Along the lines of tolerant when I got frustrated, which was alot, I didnt take it out on the other person.

3. What would you do differently?

I would outline our plan better next time. And after we had something we thought was correct, check it over and over again to make sure it cant be broken. That was a major issue for us near the end.

Reflection is good and even though I didnt like this week too much it was still a nice way to learn.
