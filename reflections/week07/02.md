## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

COde documentation is when you basically create a way to navigate code and understand it with either a tutorial, a read.me on github or documenting in the code itself. tutorials are nice but they can become outdate, read.mes are awesome because they can be maintained easier than a video tutorial, and documenting in the source is super useful because it helps the user avoid mistakes while writing the code because the instructions are right there.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

some benefits of code documenting are it helps put you back into the head space when you wrote it, it helps others navigate through your code (not everyone writes code the exact same way). Ultimately it helps anyone understand the software if they need to use it.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Code documentation can be important. Upkeeping it can become a task because it can be outdated so quickly but the benefits of doing so are worth it. It can help out your peers who you are working with and help them understand your mind.

Today was really hard. I did not feel like my partner and I were in sync. not for either of us in particular, but because I dont know how to work with someone. Im used to being able to go into my own world and figure out my problems alone when it comes to coding. i need to get better at communication.
