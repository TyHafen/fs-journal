## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

COde documentation is when you basically create a way to navigate code and understand it with either a tutorial, a read.me on github or documenting in the code itself. tutorials are nice but they can become outdate, read.mes are awesome because they can be maintained easier than a video tutorial, and documenting in the source is super useful because it helps the user avoid mistakes while writing the code because the instructions are right there.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

some benefits of code documenting are it helps put you back into the head space when you wrote it, it helps others navigate through your code (not everyone writes code the exact same way). Ultimately it helps anyone understand the software if they need to use it.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Code documentation can be important. Upkeeping it can become a task because it can be outdated so quickly but the benefits of doing so are worth it. It can help out your peers who you are working with and help them understand your mind.

Working as a team was alot better today. We worked pretty well and got good momentum. It is nice being able to take a step back when you are mentally broken and someone else can step in and share the load for a minute.
