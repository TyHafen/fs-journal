## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

UX is creating an interface that the user wants to use, not creating it how you want them to use it, but how they want to use it. You should always keep the users in mind when creating an app. It will help them stick around.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

When the app makes people feel good they will become costumers. No one wants to buy an app if it doesnt make them feel in control. Youll probably make more money too off of sales or whatever if you UX brings people in.



3. Why is the User Experience important?

It makes the user feel good, happy and in control. When you have that youll have happy customers. No one wants to use an app that doesnt make them excited.

Working as a team was alot better today. We worked pretty well and got good momentum. It is nice being able to take a step back when you are mentally broken and someone else can step in and share the load for a minute.
