## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work? 

Paired programming is when there are two people sharing a workspace, one computer for the pair. One person is the driver, meaning they are sitting at thee computer typing, while the other person acts as a navigator, who focuses on direction.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

With the idea of programming out loud precise articulation  of coding becomes a habit. Meaning youll become better at telling your partner what you mean. Another benefit is if some outside interruption happens, one person can deal with it, while the other continues to work. When the person that had to step away for a few minutes comes back, they can then be reengaged quickly.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

If you arent communicating then the process falls apart. If a partner is silent then then the momentum lows and basically you are better off working alone because you arent using a second brain or eyes.  Also being that close to someone and interacting with such complex topics can get frustrating. Tolerance of another and learning how they can communicate can be really hard.

I didnt realize how much slower getting started would be with a partner. It takes twice as long to figure something out if either of you dont understand something. And communicating what your ideas are is very hard.
