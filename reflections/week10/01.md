## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type- creates a copy of the data type that doesnt get effected when hte original type changes

Reference type- stores the address or location of the data type rather than creating a copy

Pointer type - this type is a variable whose address is another variable.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool byte char decimal double enum float int long sbyte short struct uint ulong ushort
IT seems like there are data type with regards to memory

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types dont get stored directly, it stores the address where the value is being stored. it has a pointer  to another location in memory. a Value type holds its memory within its own space.

I loved this assignment. It reminds me of when I was learning python. I love game logic like this and its super interesting to see how you can make the logic more efficient and cleaner while not making it harder to track the logic.
