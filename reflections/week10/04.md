> **ðŸ“– [C# Enums](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/03-Enums)**

## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

They are strongly types constants used when creating named integral constants.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

Enums are usually integers but that can be changed by using a base if the alternative data type used smaller storage space.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have used enums when creating a list of categories for event types in towers.

C sharp is so much intensive than node was. While its easier to write out all of your cruds methods, the sql part is slightly confusing to me. I get most of the sql statements but adding a column or dropping the whole table if the data isnt right then changing all of your tables information to have another column if you forgot something is annoying. But that is because Im a noob to it all.
