## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

It is a generic type so it can bascially be a list of anything you want, numbers to objects or strings even.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List.Add , list.Find, list.remove all seem like things i would need, Mainly because they are all the basic concepts we use when dealing with arrays, finding sometyhing by an id, removing something, adding something based on user needs.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

Id use the find method like this. list.find(c => c.id == id ) to use a unique property on a list item to obtian that object from the list

I am liking how strick cSharp is. It makes it easier to catch errors when writing out crud methods through controllers to services to repos. It makes you stay consistent throughout the entire process.
