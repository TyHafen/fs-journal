## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

the information in a row is the information for the entire object, the information in a column is the same property, like an Id or name, but for every individual object


2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
  id int NOT NULL,
  description string,
  name string,
  age string,
  
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
The delete is you are removing something from the table itself

DROP TABLE table_name;
This means you are deleting the entire table

```
