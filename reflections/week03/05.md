# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    Monday was awesome. Coming off that weekend checkpoint and into the MVC felt great and I understood it at that point.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    THe proxystate and protecting data that you dont want users to manipulate or use was really cool
- What are you struggling with?
    As the week went on it got harder and harder to follow the content. I kept getting so lost starting on wednesday that I ruined my understanding I started having on monday. This weekend project went horrible. It made me so frustrated beacuse I got more lost the longer it went on. I couldnt even understand anything that I had done correctly because I was looking for answers in the weirdest ways. I dont think I solidified any content at all.

- What would you count as a victory?
    I dont think I had a victory this week. I dug further into a hole.
