## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?
Secure Sockets Layer certificate is that create an encrypted link between the server and the browser. It discourages hackers from snagging private or important info in a 'middleman' scenario.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
Extended Validation (EV) - Shows  a padlock then HTTPS then the business name then the business countries so it cant be mistaken for spam. Hardest to obtain and highest level of encryption.

Organization Validated (OV) - This gives a medium level of encryption that shows a green padlock followed by a companies name. Generally used when you dont have the finances to get the EV cert.

Domain Validation (DV) - Relatively easy to get,  and the CA reviews the right of the applicant to own the domain. IT shows a green padlock in the address bar
