## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
An image embedded directly into a webpage. years ago a website with alot of images was limited on server requests and this was a way to take care of that issue of sending too many requests that needed to be queued.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
It increased file size by 25%, your CPu needs to decode that encoded strings then decode the images also creating extra work. The biggest draw back deals with the caching. It loads up your server and increased bandwidth.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Servers these days can support alot of requests like fetching pictures, The URL string doesnt need to be decoded and the file size hass no need to become larger. There is no need to increase bandwidth usage when the URl string used in our applications are short relative to a Base64 Encoded Image.

IT felts good knocking some major issues off of our to do list but our backend seems to need tweaking everyday. I wish we could have made that rock solid before jumping into the front end so heavily, but also its hard knowing what the backend will need since we arent too experienced with it.
