## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

Figma has helped us greatly in having a reference for the layout. In my smaller solo projects its easy to kind of know how the lay out should be but in a collaborative group this reference has been amazing. We are doing a great job of having stand ups and moving people to different tasks when they are getting burnt out and need a break

2. What went well so far?

Our morale has been great so far and we have done an amazing job of celebrating our small victories. we have all been really good at communicating our opinions and listening to others as well.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

Id go back and make sure we took enough breaks. Its so easy to overlook time and before you know it you are too burnt out by 4 that the last hour isnt as productive as it could be.

I think we need to make sure that we can somehow check busy work off of our todo work while still working on very important code like the backend. I mean things like setting up routes and simple page layouts so that when it comes time to get front side functionality moving forward, no basic styling has to happen, that it is pretty much layed out and ready to go. It would have been a massive benefit for sure to have had this done.
