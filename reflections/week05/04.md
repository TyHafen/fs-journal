## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

Virtuals are additional information on a model that do not hold space in the data base where you find them. ITs more of an attachment. For example this week in the fedex packages lecture the ships name was passed with the information about a specific package. the data for the ship has its own place in the database, and it being attached to the package is additional information.

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

You could use virtuals when needing information from the parent object. Usually you pass an ID along with the child that tells you what parent it belongs to. When you have a one to many or many to many relationship it could potentially be a good time to use vitals. For example if you had students in a a specific grade, you could use a virtual to also see what teacher they have, the teachers object being the parent object.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

You would want to use dot notation to drill into the schema. Schema.virtual.('')
what is represented in the quotes is the specific object property you want to reach from the schema. From the example I used above you would do ('shipName') to reach that virtual depending on your naming conventions

Today we prepped for our hackathon. It was really hard to get everyone on the same page because our vocabulary is all so different. Its harder than I thought it would be to streamline a simple project idea with five people.
