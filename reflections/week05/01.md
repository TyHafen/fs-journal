## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

a query string allows you to send or append information to and from a website by attaching info to the end of a URL. It can be passed into any request and can be used for anything you like.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

the start of the query is a ? mark, then variable name followed by an equal sign. the value is then passed and a perameter seperator is an &. the variable name is the title. 

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

I think it will be helpful when filtering criteria. This helps extend the functionality  of the API. It seems like it could become really strenuous when if you werent using them. trying to drill into data or reach data could become very hard without them.
