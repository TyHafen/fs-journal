## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

 a time management technique that you give a timeframe to get a task done. No matter what when th time is over you move onto the next task. this helps you not waste too much time on something especially when you run into problems and your progress slows.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?


Prioritizing - Apply the timebox idea to high priorities, dont use most of your time for non essential tasks when you have something that must be done.
swallow the frog- Make the hardest task the first. If you get that done it will give you a major boost in confidence and make you feel like you can do anything.
golden hour- understand when you are most productive. Schedule your major task during this time. Mine are between 8 and 11. i love waking up and getting right to work.


3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I would have benefitted from time boxing on checkpoint 3. I waste too much time on things I cannot get, like hours and hours. It was such a bummer. All I needed to do was move on and give myself a break or work on another thing I know I could get.

I need to logically move through my process and understand each line specifically. I fell good about servers but always getting started is the hardest part. Just because servers seems so conceptual to me, I felt like I didnt know what or how I was supposed to test.
