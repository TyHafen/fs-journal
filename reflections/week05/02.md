## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One to One - for example the houses only have description and that description only belongs to that house.

one to many (1-N) - An example of this is when a house on gregslist could have views. The house could have a ton of vies, but those views only belong to that house.

many to many (N- M) - The example given is a book and an author. One author could have many books he wrote, and books could also have many authors. We havent specifically done this one yet but it seems really interesting.


2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

The ones that I could understand are, it seems to take up less space when you link vs embedding. ANd when you attach more information when embedding it also takes the data base a long time to readjust array positions and load when looking at the database.




3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

It seems like it needs to be an early decision if (in the case of their example with books) a category of books will have many books or if the books should just be attached to the category. for example a genre could have thousands of books but one book may have one genre, maybe even two. Instead of actually embedding the book in that genre category you could just use a numbering system that attaches a number (like 2) that represents that genre, rather than embedding an entire object into that category.

Remember what needs to be passed depending on what is being used (get, put, push, getById) and understanding how to keep the client away from being able to manipulate data they shouldnt be.
