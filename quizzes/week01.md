 the yellow text in the example indicate the selector, meaning what tag, class, or ID you would like to stylize. 

 the {} hold is called the declortion block which holds all of the rules that you would like to apply to whatever you are styling.

 within the declaration block there is the property and value. idicating what aspect of the HTML youd like to manipulate. Could be text color, text or image postion, back color, etc.

**7.** What property would you change if you wanted to make a font **Bold**?

 font-weight changes the boldness of the font within CSS or you can sometimes get away with a b tag in the HTML to quickly bold a title, word or sentence so you dont have to create a totally new CSS property.

**9.** What three tags can be used to make lists (not list items)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the UL tag groups your list but in no specific order while the OL tag orders the list. within the OL or UL tag every item needs to be tagged with a LI tag which stands for List Item. Whatever order you put the items in using the LI combined with the OL tag should be how you intend the list to read on the document page


```

**10.** Define the display `:flex property:`
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
first it is important to understand that if the element isnt a flex item then this will not work. Just like how a column isnt effected by flex unless you add the class d-flex. flex-grow will grow an item relative to the size of the other items, flex-shink will do the opposite. It will shrink an item based on the size of the other items. flex-basis is just what it sounds like. its the original size of the item.

```

**11.** What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 The width and height originally assign too the box, the padding and the border all affect the size of the box model. If you add border or padding then the sppecific H*W dimensions might shrink to accomidate the additional padding or border you have added.fc
