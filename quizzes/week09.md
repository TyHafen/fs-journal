<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

A child class inherits properties from the parent class, in vue this is like when you create a v-for loop over a component and pass it information to be displayed upon render. 


```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Basically you can create an object with with one class and it can be implemented whenever you need. An example is the use of a modal, we can have multiple uses of the same modal but tagging on a new id and displaying specific information through component placed in that. There is only one modal but it can be accessed from anywhere in your code. 

```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
With this pattern where data is represented as an observer that wait for an event trigger. Whenever a change happens the observer lsitens and updates the object wherever it is located. In a one to many relationship where the data changes, it changes everywhere that data is represented.

```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
In this design pattern there can be more than one type of algorithm that can be run. It is a way to have more than one solution to a problem. Basically you can have a strategy use a different algorithm based on what it needs to accomplish.
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
This design pattern is when the client can ask for something to be created without being able to understand how or having any grasps on the creation of what they are asking for. More simply it is being handed back something without having access to the code. 

```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

There are three stages to this development style. The creation of code, the testing of it, then the refactoring of the code. You would start with writing a test, then trying the test to make sure the lack of code fails. then you would write some code in the easiest way possible to pass the test. Make sure that passes then refactor it them move onto more testing of new code. Its a way of checking code as an application is being built.

```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It stands for Definition of Done. Signified when all of the main tasks or points mentioned are complete.


```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

As a restaurant owner I want to track hours worked by employees to cut back overtime hours

As a receptionist I want to digitize the doctors schedule to stay organized



```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Th sprint backlog is created during sprint planning

```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Tasks shouldnt be assigned to you, instead a task should be taken by a worker. This insures that everyone is wanting to work on their preferred tasks. A scrum master shouldnt be assigning tasks at all.
